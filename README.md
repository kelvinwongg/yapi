# yapi
A single declarative yaml document crud api cms framwork, or whatever

You want to quickly setup a API endpoint for some data. There are many ways and frameworks that does that. But the problem is, as a professional developer, you want to work straight into the business, not spending your life for a repetitive story from every frameworks that come across:

You've spending weeks or months on learning a new framwork, reading its documentations, testing and playing along. Then, for the deliverable, you write a RESTful endpoint that simply do CRUD operations from a database.

In fact this is my career that most of the time I spent a lot of time (or months) on doing this whenever I go to a new company, just to simply store form data into a database, or even no one would bother reading this data later.
